//This is the corrected version of the example: LetterHome.java which contained 3 errors.
//The three errors corrected were as follows:
//ERROR1: Line 35: The 2nd half of the conditional statement included a >= instead of the correct >,   this made it so that the input 5, which usually would register as valid, read as invalid. (Syntax)
//ERROR2: Line 95: A misplaced ":" after the condition (m == 2) made it so that both inputs of 1 and 2 translated to the word "foggy" being printed. Deleting the semicolon fixes the error. (Syntax)
//ERROR3: Line 76: Another misplaced ":" between (else; if) caused modifierCode 3 to not be read, thus making an output of "money" impossible. This was corrected by removing the semicolon and restoring    functionality in the "else if" statement. (Syntax)
